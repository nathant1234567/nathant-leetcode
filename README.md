## My solutions to leetcode
Note: problems 1-8 contain AI generated approaches in notes.md as i cba to go through them all again lol <br>
The new problem python script is also AI generated, however I wrote search_topic :)

Reminders for myself:

new_problem: `python new_problem.py [problem number] "[Name (with spaces optional)]" [main-category] "[Catgeorys as a list for notes.md]"` <br>
`python new_problem.py 3 "Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters" strings "HashTable, SlidingWindow"` <br>
<br>
search_topics: `python search_topics.py [topic]` <br>
`python search_topics.py Array` <br>
